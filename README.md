# main_project
the main project of this semester

For my main project this first semester, I wanted to make a webpage containing my food/drink recipes
I wanted to use the scrolling function, both with mousewheel and with keys, I wanted to use
a self-running slideshow, and I wanted to use a sorting function on the recipe page.
I also wanted to implement easy redirections, and popups when different buttons were pressed.

CSS-wise I wanted to try some things out, making things overlap and look nice, but not overly fancy.
A simple home page with not too many attributes, a contact me page containing a contact form, and the
recipe page, simple but with a sorting function for if you wanted to eat meat, vegetarian or vegan.

The goal of this page was to showcase how I am able to use different javascript functions, and 
to show how my html and general code structure would be. I tried to comment as much as I could without it feeling
like I was spam commenting my code, as I want it to look rather clean. Short consise comments on what I am aiming for
or what I have planned/thought. And some comments throughout the push/pull process to explain what I was aming to do, and
how I managed to fixed things I needed to fix.

In the end I figured out I wanted to get a better feel for the website, so I added an additional toast
which I hadnt planned for, and some more redirections for the social media buttons.
I also added a few more sorting buttons, as I felt three wasnt enough for what I was trying to convey.

How the final draft will be, I am going to have to see, as I did find challenges with making it as the prototype,
and also in how I started to get tired of how the prototype looked, and wanted to make a few changes to the design.
